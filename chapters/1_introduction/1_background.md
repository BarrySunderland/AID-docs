# Background

In the past years, machine learning, especially neural network and deep learning, has evolved into a powerful tool for many different tasks, including not only traditional computer science tasks (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing), but also for other fields such as financial analysis, medical diagnosis, and so on. However, it is still a challenge to use machine learning algorithms, especially for people without machine learning background. There are numerous complaints about the difficulties of running machine learning algorithms. For example:

It is also a pity that there are so many open source machine learning libraries and frameworks. Some of them have similar functionalities but different usage. For example, TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks for roughly the same purpose, but they are not compatible with each other. It makes the process of using machine learning algorithms even more difficult as the users will need to learn different machine learning frameworks if they want to use them.

To tackle these two challenges, the AID project aims to provide the following features:

* A website for searching, viewing and downloading machine learning models.
* A unified interface for installing and running these models.
